Slime    50-1000    Paralysis/Acid    Ice/Electricity    Dungeon Slimes are a dangerous foe, they are monsters which digest humans and creatures and converts the nutrients to slime which increases it's size. Some eventually grow to the size of the hallways they travel through. When they get too big for that, they split up into two equal sized slimes. They are fairly slow, but have been known to speed up when they detect life. When they make contact instant paralysis hits the area of contact. Then anything inside them gets melted by acid over time until it's fully digested. phyiscal attacks don't affect it, only cold and electricity hurt slimes.
