#This is a test file. I will try to use it someday if I want to automate database/table/user creation.
#Make some commands here to create a database and table set up with columns/definitions, and also
#Create a user with privileges for that table. Once you can do that with this command, you won't have to go into the server
#to do it manually ever again.
#perhaps a good use would be to automatically load data from .csv/tsv/txt file into database.


#When I'm ready to use this, place it inside sqlscripts directory.
